            <p>
                   Nepal is uniquely endowed with rich and diverse natural and cultural attraction due to its geographical location in the
                  Himalayas . Nowhere else earth is there such an incomparable cultural heritage nor such a rich environmental spectrum from the highest mountains to the terai plains. Strategically located between two fastest growing countries of China and
                  India, tourism in Nepal is a sector of competitive advantages which can be instrumental in spreading benefits and providing
                  alternative economic opportunities to built peace and prosperity for the people of Nepal. It is one of the potential sectors
                  for the economic development of Nepal. It is a major source of earning foreign currency<br>
                         Tourism is one of the potential sectors for the economic development of Nepal. It becomes a major source of earning
                  foreign currency. Expansion of tourism sector expands the employment and income generation opportunity. Due to
                  location of birth place of Lord Buddha, center of faith of Hinduism Pashupatinath, world heritage sites and numerous
                  culturally valued places, Nepal is considered major destination for social tourism. Possession of 8 of the 10 highest
                  mountains in the world and many more natural assets makes it a hotspot destination for mountaineers, rock climbers
                  and other many adventure tourists. The religious harmony among communities, linguistics and culturally diverse people
                  and climatic and geographical variations lure visitors worldwide.<br>
                  to develop tourism infrastructure; airports, roads, trails and other facilities. Current tourism policy,
                  strategic action plan and development plan are keeping focus to develop tourism sector as important sector of economy, supporting
                  people's livelihood  and uplifting living standards<br><br>

            <h2>Linear Regression in Python with Scikit-Learn</h2>
            <h3>Linear Regression</h3><br>
"linearity" in algebra refers to a linear relationship between two or more variables. If we draw this relationship in a two dimensional space (between two variables, in this case), we get a straight line.
            A regression model involving multiple variables can be represented as:<br><br>

          y = b0 + m1*b1 + m2*b2 + m3*b3 + ... ... mn*bn<br><br>

            <h3>Machine Learning Pipeline</h3><br>
Before we look at an example of implementing multiple linear regression on an actual data set, let's take a moment to understand the machine learning workflow or pipeline.

Every implementation of machine learning algorithms has the same basic components. You need to:<br><br>

Prepare the data<br>
Create the model<br>
Train the model<br>
Evaluate the model<br><br>
Preparing the data is frequently one of the most challenging parts of machine learning, as it involves not only collecting the data but then transforming that data into a format that can be utilized by your chosen algorithm. This involves many tasks like dealing with missing values or corrupted/malformed data. For this reason, we will be using a premade data set that requires little preprocessing.

Creating the machine learning model is fairly straightforward when using a library like Scikit-Learn. There are typically only a few lines of code necessary to instantiate a given machine learning algorithm. However, there are different arguments and parameters these algorithms take that will affect your model's accuracy. The art of choosing the correct parameter values for the model will come to you over time, but you can always refer to the algorithm's documentation in your chosen library to see which parameters you can experiment with.

Training the model is also rather straight-forward when using a library like Scikit-Learn, as once more there are usually only a few lines of code needed to train the algorithm on your chosen data set.

<br>However, you must be sure you have divided your data into training and testing sets. You cannot evaluate the performance of your classifier on the same data set you have trained it on, as your model has already learned the parameters of this set of data. Evaluating the data on the training set won't give you any insight regarding your model's performance on another data set.
